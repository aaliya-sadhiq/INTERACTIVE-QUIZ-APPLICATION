DESCRIPTON ABOUT INTERACTIVE QUIZ APPLICATION

            The Interactive Quiz Application is a front-end web development project designed to test users' knowledge through multiple-choice questions. This application has been development using three application has been developed using three core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates fundamenal front-end development skills including user interaction,DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic content loading.

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED

    The primary tehnologies used in this project are:

           1. HTML(hyper Text Markup Language):

              HTML is used to create the structure of the web application. it defines the layout of the web application. it defines the layout of the registration form,quiz section, and result section. The HTML file includes input fields, buttons, headings, and containers that organize the content properly. The structure ensures that different sections(registration, quiz, and results) can be shown or hidden dynamically using JavaScript.

           2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

              CSS is used to design and style the applicaton. it enhances the visual appearance by adding background gradients, spacing, button styles, hover effects, font formatting, and alignment. The design uses a modern gradient background and centered layout to provide a clean and user-friendly interface. CSS classes such as .correct and .wrong are used to visually indicate whether the selected answer is right or wrong.

           3. JavaScript:
              
              JavaScript is responsible for the functionality and interactivity of the quiz application. It handles:
              
              Registration validation (checking if the user entered their name)

              Dynamic question loading

              Option selection

              Answer checking

              Score calculation

              Moving to the next question
             
              Displaying final results

 The questions are stored inside a JavaScript array as objects. Each object contains the question, multiple options, and the correct answer index. JavaScript dynamically updates the webpage without reloading it, making the application interactive.
 
           EDITOR PLATFORM USED

              This project can be developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which is a widely used code editor for web development. VS Code provides features such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion, extensions, and live server support, which make development easier and more efficient. The project files are separated into three parts:
index.html

           style.css
           
           script.js
           
These files are linked together to create a complete functional web application. The application can be run using a web browser such as Google Chrome by opening the HTML file directly or using the Live Server extension in VS Code.

           HOW THE APPLICATION WORKS

              The application begins with a registration section where the user enters their name. This ensures personalization of the quiz experience. If the name field is empty, an alert message appears requesting the user to enter their name.
           Once registered, the quiz section becomes visible. The application dynamically loads one question at a time. The user selects an answer by clicking on one of the options. Immediate feedback is displayed indicating whether the selected answer is correct or wrong. The score is updated accordingly.
When the user clicks the “Next” button, the application loads the next question. This continues until all questions are completed. Finally, the result section is displayed, showing the user’s name and total score.

           PURPOSE AND USAGE OF THE WEBSITE

           This quiz application can be used in various environments such as:

           Educational institutions for conducting small assessments
            
           Online learning platforms for practice quizzes

           Internship training tasks

           Technical skill evaluation
          
           Knowledge testing applications
It can also be extended with additional features like timers, certificates, random question generation, or database integration for real-world implementation.

          CONCLUSION
          
          The Interactive Quiz Application successfully demonstrates front-end web development skills by combining structure (HTML), design (CSS), and logic (JavaScript). It provides an engaging and interactive user experience with scoring and dynamic question loading. This project fulfills the requirement of creating a polished quiz application and showcases the practical implementation of web development concepts.
